The class constructor method can be called with 1 or 2 arguments

```php
$grid = new datagrid(str $table_name, [mixed $db]);
```

Table name: the name of the primary DB table that the grid will be editing. Unless a grid title is set, this will also be used for the display title of the grid (underscores are replaced with spaces and first letter uppercased).

$db: the database connection. This can be one of five different things
  1. an associative array of database credentials, with the following items

```php
    array(
        'db'=>'database_name',
        'host'=>'localhost',
        'user'=>'db_username',
        'pass'=>'db_password'
    );
```

  2. a string containing the database name (other credentials will be used from the config file).
  3. a object of the $database class (see database.class.php)
  4. A mysqli link resource
  5. NULL, in which case the credentials and the database name will be used from the config file.
