## Parent and child tables

### Parent tables

Datagrid allows you to add tables as 'parents' -- that is, other tables whose records have a one-to-many relationship to the records in your primary DG table.

For example, you might have a 'departments' table and an 'products' table. They might look like this:

**Departments**
| department_id | department_name |

**Products**
| product_id | department_id | price | description |

If your main grid is editing the products table, you can add the departments as a parent table. This will create a select input on the product editing page that will allow the user to select which of the departments in the departments table that product belongs to.

Here's the code:

```php
$grid->add_parent_table($table, $local_key, $foreign_key[, $display_field]);
```
$table : name of main DG table
$local_key : link field in main DG table
$foreign_key : link field in parent table
$display_field : field in parent table that should be the human-readable, visible value to be selected (optional)


```php
$grid->add_parent_table('departments','department_id','department_id','department_name');
```


### Child tables

Tables that have a many-to-one relationship to your primary table can be added as 'child' tables. These appear either in a drop-out iframe below the parent record, or in a popup window. See the 'child.php' example file.

```php
$grid->add_child_table('comments','post_id','post_id');
$grid->set_table_attribs('comments',array('edit_url'=>'child.php', 'display_type'=>'iframe'));
```
