The attributes for a field are an associative array that determines most of the how that field is handled, both for display and editing. Here is a table that covers all field attribute variables.


| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| type     | Type of field. See Reference:Field types |
| edit_style | Style info for edit field |
| edit_class | Set the class of the edit form input |
| display_style | Style info for grid display |
| display_class | Set the class of grid element |
| edit_callback | Edit callback function name |
| save_callback | Save callback function name |
| display_callback | Display callback function name |
| display_template | HTML template that database values will be plugged into for display. See Display templates |
| display_type | A lightly used attribute that can be set to 'none' to disable this field from displaying in the grid at all, or to 'currency' to format value as currency |
| default | Default value for the field |
| notes | Text that displays beside the field in the edit form |
| truncate | If this is set the contents of the field will be truncated to the specified length (in characters) before being displayed in the grid |


A field's attributes can be set individually using

```php
$grid->set_field_attrib($table,$field,$attrib,$value);
```

Or in bulk using

```php
$grid->set_field_attribs($table,$field,array($attrib1=>$value1[,$attrib2=>$value2], etc);
```
